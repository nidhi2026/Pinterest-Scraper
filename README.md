# Pinterest-Scraper
Are you ready! Let's scrape Pinterest and add cool-cool images to your collection just by one tap , YES, automating Pinterest with Selenium

# PREFACE
This code-setup will go to pinterest and login into your pinterest account using your credentials (which you would have filled up in login.py before running)
And the search for two choices from randomized list of fav_items, where selenium will have some images downloaded in a blink for us!

Try for yourself !

# SELENIUM'S AWESOMENESS
A fan of pinterest photos, wanna make a collection but so much of a work to do manually, now DONT'T WORRY!
Automation will do that for us

# Result
Selenium will create a new folder called fav which will be having 2 sub-folders (and the fun part - the names of folders will be according to your choice)
